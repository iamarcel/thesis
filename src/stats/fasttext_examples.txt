__label__5 robots are actually very special they
__label__5 physically there you can kind of
__label__5 physically touch a robot and to try this
__label__5 further we took a robot into school and
__label__4 impact that diabeetus leaves so there's
__label__4 so it's quite intimidating for a young
__label__4 child to be diagnosed with diabetes and
__label__4 it also puts quite a lot of strain on
__label__4 the healthcare system and the medical
__label__4 staff in hospital said look if you could
__label__4 build a robot that could help children
__label__4 understand their condition of a bit
__label__4 better and manage their diabetes better
__label__4 that would be a huge relief for us so we
__label__4 set to work and I'll show you a little
__label__4 working with children with diabetes

__label__8 parallel you're paralyzed I get it
__label__6 it's overwhelming the paralysis of
__label__6 choice open up Netflix how many times
__label__6 have you spent browsing for 20 minutes
__label__6 and then it's like I want to watch
__label__6 anything no matter what you choose is
__label__6 not gonna be the right thing it's up so
__label__8 uh you have to figure out this this
__label__8 passion thing from all the possible ways
__label__7 in which you could invest yourself
__label__7 Steven Kotler also from the flow Genome
__label__6 Project wrote this article in Forbes
__label__1 that I was like holy he
__label__8 deconstructed passion here is the
__label__6 formula and I'm not into like worksheets
__label__7 and workshops to teach you how to do
__label__8 this stuff but this was so clear then I
__label__6 was like oh got to make a video
__label__8 about it here's how you find your
__label__7 passion if you don't know it you make a
__label__3 list of 15 things that you're really
__label__3 curious about right Elizabeth Gilbert
__label__8 who wrote Eat Pray Love often talks
__label__8 about the pressure of knowing your
__label__8 passion and she says if you don't know
__label__6 your passion at least chase curiosity
__label__6 because at least you know things you're
__label__7 curious about them you can make a list
__label__7 so Cutler goes on make a list of 15
__label__8 things are curious about so let's say
__label__7 give me flow these are the things I'm
__label__7 curious about these are were these
__label__7 things I'm curious about overlap and
__label__7 they overlap in ways that if I go this
__label__7 direction I can also be in flow when
__label__7 those curiosities overlap
__label__7 holy-shit and there's the purpose that I
__label__7 can serve by being in flow playing with
__label__7 all the things I'm curious about and
__label__8 you figured it out that's it
__label__6 done go home bye like that's the
__label__6 solution I try to apply that to my own
__label__6 life I ask myself you know on darker
__label__6 days you know if I have a cold and I'm
__label__8 then she'll meltdown because my body's
__label__6 not performing that they I'm like okay
__label__8 things that I really love and I'm
__label__8 passionate about all these things I want
__label__7 to talk about them in my videos and
__label__6 making the video that's great people
__label__7 seem to like the videos okay so that's
__label__6 good I have a have a purpose you know
__label__8 and then finally right this this love
__label__3 for technology that I was talking about
__label__3 again a metaphor for all the ways in
__label__3 which we redefine our boundaries in the
__label__3 world right so the guys behind the
__label__6 XPrize foundation recently came up with
__label__7 this idea in terms of like you know
__label__7 purpose they're like in the age of
__label__1 exponential technologies and the age in
__label__1 the age in which a young person in rural
__label__7 Africa with a smartphone has better
__label__7 communications technology than a head of
__label__3 that he needs to make correctly along the way
__label__2 in order to move the probability
__label__1 in favor of him achieving these types of results.
__label__6 defaults whatever you present to the person you're designing for like they
__label__6 person you're designing for like they will most often just take that and so
__label__6 will most often just take that and so don't make that decision without enough
__label__1 don't make that decision without enough thought we're lazy
__label__1 and so we called them creative realms and my co-founder matias who is here
__label__6 and my co-founder matias who is here whenever he would talk about it he would
__label__1 whenever he would talk about it he would always say like realm's and I was like
__label__6 always say like realm's and I was like if you're if your co-founder can't
__label__1 colleagues it's my privilege to speak to you today about the power of big data
__label__1 you today about the power of big data and psychographics in the electoral
__label__1 process and specifically to talk about the work that we contributed to Senator
__label__7 the work that we contributed to Senator Cruz's presidential primary campaign
__label__1 Cruz's presidential primary campaign it's easy to forget that only 18 months
__label__1 it's easy to forget that only 18 months ago senator Cruz was one of the less
__label__1 in addition to which he had very low name recognition only about 40 percent
__label__1 of the electorate had heard of him as compared to Jeb Bush shop in the mid 80s
